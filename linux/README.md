Bubble for Linux
================

----

We have not yet created a native Bubble client for Linux.

To connect your Linux system to your Bubble, you will need to:

  * [Install your Bubble Certificate](https://github.com/getbubblenow/bubble-docs/blob/master/cert_instructions/linux_cert.md)
  * Firefox users: [install your Bubble Certificate in Firefox](https://github.com/getbubblenow/bubble-docs/blob/master/cert_instructions/firefox_cert.md)
  * [Install and Configure WireGuard](https://github.com/getbubblenow/bubble-docs/blob/master/vpn_instructions/linux_vpn.md)
